 Copyright and Licensing Information

 ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), and CoSMIC(TM)
 (henceforth referred to as "DOC software")
 are copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and his research group
 at Washington University, University of California,
 Irvine, and Vanderbilt University,
 Copyright (c) 1993-2012, all rights reserved.
 Since DOC software is open-source, freely available software,
 you are free to use, modify, copy, and distribute
 --perpetually and irrevocably--
 the DOC software source code and object code
 produced from the source,
 as well as copy and distribute modified versions of this software.
 You must, however, include this copyright statement
 along with any code built using DOC software that you release.
 No copyright statement needs to be provided
 if you just ship binary executables of your software products.
 .
 You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases
 and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code
 that is built using DOC software.
 Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code,
 such as copyrighting it yourself
 or claiming authorship of the DOC software code,
 in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely
 using an open-source development model.
 You needn't inform anyone
 that you're using DOC software in your software,
 though we encourage you to let us know
 so we can promote your project in the DOC software success stories.
 .
 The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites
 are maintained by the DOC Group
 at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS)
 and the Center for Distributed Object Computing
 of Washington University, St. Louis
 for the development of open-source software
 as part of the open-source software community.
 Submissions are provided by the submitter "as is"
 with no warranties whatsoever,
 including any warranty of merchantability,
 noninfringement of third party intellectual property,
 or fitness for any particular purpose.
 In no event shall the submitter be liable
 for any direct, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive,
 or consequential damages,
 including without limitation,
 lost profits,
 even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
 Likewise, DOC software is provided as is
 with no warranties of any kind,
 including the warranties of design, merchantability,
 and fitness for a particular purpose,
 noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing,
 usage or trade practice.
 Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
 their employees, and students shall have no liability
 with respect to the infringement of copyrights,
 trade secrets or any patents
 by DOC software or any part thereof.
 Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine,
 or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be liable
 for any lost revenue or profits or other special,
 indirect and consequential damages.
 .
 DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation
 on the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University,
 their employees, or students
 to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement.
 A number of companies around the world
 provide commercial support for DOC software, however.
 DOC software is Y2K-compliant,
 as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant.
 Likewise, DOC software is compliant
 with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress
 as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005,"
 which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules
 for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007.
 Since DOC software obtains time/date and calendaring information
 from operating systems
 users will not be affected by the new DST rules
 as long as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.

 from Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University.
 This license grants no permission
 to call products or services derived

 nor does it grant permission
